# Predicting-Transparent-Conductors
The aim of this challenge is to predict the physical properties of specific types of Transparent Conductors.Essentially,
these are high-tech materials that can be designed, pretty much atom by atom, from a large range of different
quantities of the chemical elements Aluminium (Al), Gallium (Ga), and Indium (In).
There are two targets we need to predict for each material: the formation energy (indicator for its stability) and the
bandgap energy (indicating its transparency). Those will be continuous variables which makes this a regression
problem. We are tasked with predicting the “key performance indicators” of each material based on different features.
